# Python Programs

A collection of small Python programs written while learning and practicing core concepts of Python.  
Each file covers a specific problem or feature — from simple logic exercises to slightly more practical use cases.

##  Overview

This repository is built to document my progress as I explore Python fundamentals and problem-solving.  
It includes short scripts that focus on:
- Basic syntax and operations  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets  
- Functions and modules  
- File handling and string manipulation  
- Small problem-solving snippets  

Each program is standalone and can be run individually.
